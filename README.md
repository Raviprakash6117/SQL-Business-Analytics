# SQL-Business-Analytics
SQL-based project answering real-world business questions with queries
## 📋 Description

The dataset represents a fictional **restaurant sales business**, containing tables like:

- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `menu_items`
- `customers`
- `discounts`

Using this data, the project answers key business questions such as:

- 🔝 Which are the top-selling food items?
- 💰 What is the average order value?
- 🍔 Which is the most popular food category?
- 📅 On which day of the week do we receive the most orders?
- 📈 How has the monthly revenue trend evolved?

Each question is answered using optimized SQL queries, and the results are summarized in query outputs and visual reports.

- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`
- Time-based grouping with `DATE_TRUNC()` / `STRFTIME()`
- `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`, `AS` (aliasing)
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
